# IPFTools
Tools for the Techno-Brain 256-Color Picture Format(IPF), mostly wrapping iph33.dll - at this point just a simple IPF->BMP command-line tool.
## Prerequisites
* VS2013
* A copy of iph33.dll

## Building
Fairly straightforward - throw your copy of iph33.dll into /lib, then open IPFTools.sln and hit build.
